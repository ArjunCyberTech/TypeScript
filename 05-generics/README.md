# 05 generics

Generics allow you to create reusable components that work with a variety of types rather than a single one. This provides flexibility while maintaining type safety.

- **Generic Functions**: A function that can work with any type. The type is specified when the function is called.
- **Generic Classes**: Classes that can operate on different data types.
- **Generic Interfaces**: Interfaces that define a type that works with other types.
- **Generic Constraints**: Restricting the types that can be used with a generic to ensure they have specific properties.
