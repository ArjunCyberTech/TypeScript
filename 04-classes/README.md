# 04 classes

TypeScript supports full-featured object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes. Classes are blueprints for creating objects and encapsulate data and methods.

- **Properties**: Variables that hold the state of the object.
- **Methods**: Functions that define the object's behavior.
- **Constructor**: A special method called when a new object is created.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class (`child class`) inherits properties and methods from an existing class (`parent class`).
- **Access Modifiers**: Keywords (`public`, `private`, `protected`) that control the visibility of class members.
