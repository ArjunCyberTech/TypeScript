# 01 Basic Types

TypeScript provides several built-in types to ensure code safety and clarity. This section covers the fundamental data types, including `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, and `tuple`.

- **string**: Represents textual data.
- **number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
- **boolean**: Represents a true or false value.
- **Array**: A collection of values of the same type.
- **Tuple**: An array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known.
- **any**: A type that can be anything, used when the type isn't known. It bypasses type checking, so it should be used sparingly.
