# 07 modules

Modules help organize code into separate, reusable files. This makes code more manageable, scalable, and easier to maintain by preventing global namespace pollution.

- **Export**: Use the `export` keyword to make a variable, function, class, or interface available to other files.
- **Import**: Use the `import` keyword to access a module's exported members.
- **Default Exports**: A module can have one default export, often used for a single main class or function.
- **Named Exports**: Used for exporting multiple members from a single file.
