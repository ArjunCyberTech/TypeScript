# 08 enums (Enumerations)

Enums are a way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric or string values. They help make a set of related constants more readable and less error-prone.

- **Numeric Enums**: The default enum type. The first member is initialized to `0` and subsequent members are auto-incremented.
- **String Enums**: Each member must be initialized with a string literal. String enums are more readable and can be a good choice when you want a descriptive string value.
